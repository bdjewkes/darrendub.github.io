title: Why are you doing this?

Hey there, my name is Darren and I design things for the internet and people like you. I will be using this space to document the live redesign of my brand new site! I am doing this for a few reasons:

- Build some momentum to redesign my current [site](http://darrendavenwong.com)
- Share my process and learn from that process
- Get input early and often from viewers like you
- Be accountable for delivering a brand spanking new site

I will be using this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/timeline/index.html">timeline</a> to keep track of my updates and this blog to post articles, snippets and thoughts as I develop my site. I make things for the web and want to share how I make those things.

Designing in the open is not a new idea, great devsigners like <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/">Brad Frost</a>, <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/">Dan Mall</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/screencasting-complete-redesign-get-access-kickstarter/">Chris Coyier</a> to name a few, have used this technique to utilize our great open community to help further their deisign decisions. 

There is an awesome live redesign of CodePen by Sparkbox happening now! [Check it out &#8594;](http://codepen.seesparkbox.com/)

### Goals
- Deliver a new site in six months
- Develop in depth case studies for my work
- Develop a blog to write about design and development
- Increase engangement on social media
- Increase website performance
- Make a website I am proud of

I'm nervous and excited to get started. I think this will be fun exercise to push my skills and develop my confidence.

Wish me luck!

Darren
