Hey there, my name is Darren and I design things for the Internet and people like you. I will be using this space to document the open redesign of my brand new site! I am doing this for a few reasons:

- Build some momentum to redesign my current [site](http://darrendavenwong.com)
- Share my process and learn from that process
- Get input early and often from viewers like you
- Be accountable for delivering a brand spanking new site

I will be using this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/timeline/">timeline</a> to keep track of my updates and this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/weblog/">blog</a> to post articles, snippets and thoughts as I develop my site. I make things for the web and want to share how I make those things.

<p class="message"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/weblog/2015/04/17/redesign-brief/">Here is the full redesign brief &#8594;</a></p>

Designing in the open is not a new idea, great _dev-signers_ like <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/">Brad Frost</a>, <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/">Dan Mall</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/screencasting-complete-redesign-get-access-kickstarter/">Chris Coyier</a>, have used this technique to utilize our great open community to help further their design decisions. 

There is an awesome live redesign of CodePen by Sparkbox happening now! [Check it out &#8594;](http://codepen.seesparkbox.com/)

I’m nervous and excited to get started. I think this will be fun exercise to push my skills and develop my confidence.

Wish me luck!
