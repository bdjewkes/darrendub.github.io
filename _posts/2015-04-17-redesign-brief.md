###Background
One of the most disabling diseases plaguing designers today is the inability to create for ourselves (or at least be satisfied with the things we create). This disease has roots that trace back to the world's earliest designers who used cave walls to put up their mock ups.

Take note of the many hands over lapping, you can imagine the internal struggle of this primordial designer saying, *"Are there too many hands?*...*Fred, I think I need a complete overhaul, a redesign*." It’s in our blood to continue to redefine ourselves to push our creative abilities, to forever carry the burden of being incomplete. This insatiable desire to hold the highest of standards of our own work is not ill fated, it drives us and makes us stronger, better, faster, stronger?

Which leads us to present time and I say to my friend Fred,
 
*"I think I need a complete overhaul, a redesign."*

However instead of designing in a silo or cave, I'm going to design out in the open. I'm going to bring you all along as I go, to keep me in check, to send me happy notes and most importantly give me feedback early and often. This will also be an experiment to discover my process (which has never before been documented, until now). So come along and lets do this thing!

####Project Summary: 
I need to create a fast, responsive, delightful experience on the web to showcase my work.I will have a blog to document my thoughts about design and other musings. The site will also increase my presence and friendships on twitter. 

####Goals
- Deliver a new site in 4 months
- Increase website performance
- Increase engagement on social media
- Develop in depth case studies for my work
- Develop a blog to write about design and development


####Measures of Success:
_Performance:_ A user should begin to see the website rendering in 100ms. This should produce a speed index score of 1000ms and to get there my site should deliver the critical path view in the first 14kb of the page. (via Paul Irish, ["Delivering the goods" - Fluent 2014 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8W_6xWphtw))

_Blog:_ 1,000 Visits, Post twice a week

_Twitter:_ 10 new followers, 40 Shares

_Design:_ High fives from colleagues

_Happiness:_ A site that I am proud of


####Schedule:

My schedule for this project is going to be a little further out than a traditional website project. This redesign unfortunately will not be the only thing I'm working on. I have a full time job (we're <a href="http://grnh.se/j2e8bl">hiring</a>), a full time girlfriend (she's not hiring), and a part time side project (<a href="http://www.smokedmeatsaturdays.com/">sms</a>). I want to give this redesign a fighting chance of coming to fruition. I'm also an advocate of the under promise, over deliver policy... ya let's go with that.

####Final Thoughts
I want to walk away from this project with a website that I am proud of. A website that is fast loading. A website that makes use of a system of design patterns and modular code. A website that is set in beautiful (legible) type. A website that is set with beautiful words that communicate my work and who I am. I think I will learn a lot from this process and I can't wait to get started.
