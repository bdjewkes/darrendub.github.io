		  <h4 class="text-white">Summary</h4>
		  <p class="text-white">In late 2014, a major shift happened at Inkling. We went from crafting eBooks targeted at academics to creating a platform for businesses to create, share, and measure their most important content. This pivot changed a lot of things and one of those things would be the inkling.com website.</p>
		  <h4 class="text-white">Problem</h4>
		  <p class="text-white">We inherited a lot of legacy code from when we were <i>just</i> an eBook store and during our change in business strategy we invited a lot of developers into that code to help the site get up and running quickly. Everyone in there at once with no version control (or any tools for that matter) made for some pretty smelly code. We saw an opportunity to not only revamp our code but to ensure it was optimized for success.</p>

		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>Project Hemingway: code drunk, refactor sober would be the codename for our grand redesign of the website. I started by auditing and identifying patterns on the existing site as well as patterns we may use in the future. I then designed mocks at various screen sizes (mobile experience was huge for us during this process). I then took it a step further and started to rough out the patterns in code. This would ensure a seamless pass-off to the developer. These patterns would be extensible which would give us the freedom of many types of layouts.</p><br>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>We did a complete overhaul of the entire site in 28 days. We built versioning/testing environments, began a documentation process, updated 20+ web pages, penned thousands of lines of css, nursed pixel cuts, and delivered a beautiful, well built, B2B website!</p>
