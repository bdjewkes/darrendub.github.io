        <h4 class="text-white">Summary</h4>
        <p class="text-white">In late 2014, a major shift happened at Inkling. We went from crafting eBooks targeted at academics to creating a platform for businesses to create, share, and measure their most important content. This pivot changed a lot of things, one of which was the inkling.com website.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-cell">
        <h4 class="text-white">Results</h4>
        <p class="text-white">We did a complete overhaul of the entire site in 28 days. We built versioning/testing environments, began a documentation process, updated 20+ web pages, penned thousands of lines of CSS, nursed pixel cuts, and delivered a beautiful, well built, B2B website!</p>

    <h1 class="text-center mt1">The Process</h1>
    <p><b>Project Hemingway: code drunk, refactor sober</b> would be the codename for our grand redesign of the website. I started by auditing and identifying patterns on the existing site as well as patterns we may use in the future. I then designed mocks at various screen sizes (mobile experience was huge for us during this process). I then took it a step further and started to rough out the patterns in code. This would ensure a seamless pass-off to the developer. These patterns would be extensible which would give us the freedom of many types of layouts.</p>
