      <h4 class="text-white">Summary</h4>
      <p class="text-white">Inkling began by building interactive, digital textbooks. However, over the years, Inkling expanded its library to include travel guides, medical references, and cookbooks to mobile devices near you. They needed a visual system to bring these new categories under one roof.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-cell">
    <h4 class="text-white">Results</h4>
      <p class="text-white">I created twelve unique icons to represent our categories. These icons help strengthen the connection between categories and interactive inkling eBooks and communicated that Inkling has relevant content for every user. They were well-received and began to make their into the product, website, and marketing materials.

    <h1 class="text-center">The Process</h1>

    <p>In its early days, Inkling leveraged illustrations to help  bring its categories to life. The illustrations were beautiful, smart, human, and inspiring. This is an example of the illustrations used to help onboard new users into the product:</p>

    <h1 class="text-center">Inspiration</h1>
    <img class="center mt1" style="max-width:300px;" src="../public/img/curiosity-shoppe/noma.png">

    <p class="mt1">Our art director at the time, Brendan, had begun collect inspiration and a designer that really stood out was <a class="link-text" href="http://dutchuncle.co.uk/noma-bar/" target="_blank">Noma Bar</a>. His work entices  viewers to survey the entire piece and really study it until the arrangement of colors and space would reveal the hidden message. This would be especially important later in the design process.

    <h4>Concepts</h4>
    <p>We identified a handful of concepts we wanted to emulate in these illustrations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delightful</li>
      <li>Curious</li>
      <li>Deeper Meaning</li>
      <li>Narrative</li>
      <li>Lets the viewer connect the dots</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>History Lesson</h4>
    <p>The Inkling logo was based on this idea of a slow reveal, unveiling the full work in front of the viewers eyes. The <a class="link-text" href="http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/archive/typographicarchitect">Invitation for Galerie Anatome Wim Crouwel: Architectures Typographiques, 1956â€“1976</a> worked with dissembling type and empowered the viewers of the work to assemble the piece back together.</p>

    <p class="mt1">I was interested in this for a few reasons.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This style and conception was deeply tied to our company's history</li>
      <li>The gaps within these icons made the whole composition more interesting. Causing a viewer to look a little more closely.</li>
      <li>These icons empowered users to try to piece together what they were looking at and they had an ah-ha moment once they got it.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1 class="text-center">New Beginnings</h1>
  <p>Just after this launch, Inkling  began to pivot to a B2B market. Without our store and category offering these icons did not make much sense in our new B2B world. However, the core styles and ideas developed during this process would become the foundation in the illustration and iconography we create today.</p>
