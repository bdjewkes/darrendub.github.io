		  <h4>Summary</h4>

		  <p>Inkling's humble beginnings wanted to solve the textbook. In its first two years the company went from better text books to interactive content for any type of material. During the time of 2013 I served on the Design core team asked with upholding the brand and assisting our internal teams with their brand needs, one of those teams was the product team. </p>

		<h2 class="large-type text-center">Icons</h2>

		<p>We had just updated our category offering, shedding our academic skin and becoming a more well rounded eBook provider. Bringing travel guides, medical references, and cookbooks to mobile devices near you. We needed an system to bring all of our categories under on roof which would live on our site, apps, and advertisements.</p>

		<p>I was tasked with developing a suite of icons, creating an identity for our new category experience.</p>

		<p>Our current problem is that our current icons used were wonderful, but a little outdated and not part of the same aesthetic in our current arsenal. These icons would be used on the website, collateral, and more importantly our app.</p>

		<p>We had just released our first android app and in addition to revamping the icon system I was given the opportunity to rethink how we onboard new users. Our current system asks users what type of topics they were interested in so that we could auto fill their library with a chapter from a title in that category. #NoEmptyStates</p>

		<p>This got people exploring the free chapter, tapping on interesting interactives, and potentially purchasing the whole book (fingers crossed).</p>

		<p>The biggest problem with this is that there was no hand-off. From a users perspective they tapped some categories and then there were these random books in their library.</p>

		<p>Along with creating a new suite of icons I would be taking a look at the entire onboarding process as well.</p>

		<h2 class="large-type text-center">Inspiration</h2>

		<p>Our art director Brendan, had begun to collect swipe for inspiration. A designer that really stood out was Norma. {Update with link} He was able to take really complex idea using color ans illustration to create a smart piece. The viewer had to read the words, look at the image, read the words again and in this exchange something finally clicked and you understood the whole piece. What is really special is that he never laid out the whole story as you would suspect. He let the viewer recreate the scene. He gave them the parts and tools but never the answers. This would be especially important later.</p>

		<h2>Concepts</h2>
		<p>We identified a handful of concepts we wanted to emulate in these illustrations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Delightful</li>
			<li>Curious</li>
			<li>Deeper Meaning</li>
			<li>Tells a Story</li>
			<li>Lets the viewer connect the dots</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Sketching</h2>
		<p>We sketched a lot. These categories are not brand new ideas so our early sketches weren't so far from ones we’ve seen in the wild. Brendan pushed us to try new things and borrow from some of the concepts we saw in Norma’s work.</p>
		<p>[IMAGES OF SKETCHES]</p>

		<h2>Finesse</h2>
		<p>From the sketching a few things became clear. We wanted the icons to tell a story. I was also very interested in using the line length to help infer entire scenes. I became interested in breaking the connection of complete lines so that a viewer had to piece together the entire scene.</p>
		<p>[IMAGES]</p>
		<p>This is what our inkling logo was based on the work by wilem crouwel. His famous piece, "name of piece" worked with dissembling type and empowered the viewers of the work to assemble the piece back together.</p>
		<p>[Inkilng image and wilem image]</p>
		<p>I was interested in this for a few reasons.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>this style and conception was deeply tied to our company's history</li>
			<li>the gaps within these icons made the whole composition more interesting. Causing a viewer to look a little more closely.</li>
			<li>these icons empowered users to try to piece together what they were looking at and they had an ah-ha moment once they got it.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2 class="large-type text-center">Get on board</h2>
	<p>After crafting the icons I was given the opportunity to think about our onboarding system.</p>

	<h2>Explores</h2>
	<p>I wanted to achieve a few things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>show interactives sooner</li>
		<li>tighter connection between icon and free book (chapter)</li>
		<li>a more consistent experience from onboarding to app</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once the user picked the categories they cared about, we surfaced cards with relevant content and interactives. These also integrated very well with the icons created. I also wanted to give a sneak peak into the interactives of these eBooks sooner rather than later so they would be pumped to dive into their books.</p>

	<p>An issue arose with the current onboarding that when a user selected categories they were taken to their library with seemingly random books downloading. To lift this confusion, on the interactive card the book title, icon, and interactive was all present. So that even if they skimmed past it they may have caught the title of the book which would help with memory when they got to their library.</p>

	<p>Another way to help was to remind the users why these books were in their library. I used a overlay over the books with the icon that they selected to create a unison between icon and title.</p>

<!-- <p class="text-center mt-1">How'd we do?</p> -->
<p>We created twelve unique icons to represent our categories. These icons help strengthen the connection between categories and interactive inkling eBooks. It showcased that Inkling has content that is relevant to any user, helping them quickly see the value inkling could add in their life. The purpose of this project was to help fill a readers library with content that was relevant to them.</p>

<h2 class="large-type text-center">This is not the onboarding you're loooking for</h2>

<p>The icons were extremely well received. After delivering my user flow for the newly crafted onboaring system it received varying forms of sign-off we ultimately went in a more streamlined flow for a few reasons.</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>While we were creating the interactive cards option, we were running tests on the current on boarding. With the hypothesis that a user persona or benefits approach would be more beneficial to a user than categories.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="grid grid-gutters grid-full">
    <div class="grid-cell">
      <h1 class="text-center">Benefits</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-cell">
      <h1 class="text-center">Persona</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-cell">
      <h1 class="text-center">List</p>
    </div>
  </div>


<p>Tested 5 android users on a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 10. Six people on a iOS device.
Our awesome research team, led by Meg, did a lot of user testing and here are a few key findings:
*People ain’t got time for that*
When prompted with a few on boarding screens many people swiped/did not read the copy on the screens. They wanted to get into the product as soon as possible.</p>

<b>Engage me</b>
<p>Since the screens were static images people quickly lost interest and wanted to leave the on boarding modal screen. Because they were images it felt like just a barrier to entry.</p>


<b>Show me</b>
<p>We also required people to sign up before someone got into the actual app to see the categories they chose. Which was a huge barrier to entry. They didn’t know what the app was about so why would they give you their information.</p>

<b>We both lose</b>
<p>We tested a user vs benefits on boarding flow and neither won. There was more negative response to a user persona since it was really hit or miss weather they connected with the persona and if they didn’t connect with the persona maybe this app wasn’t for them.</p>

<b>tl;dr</b>
<ul>
	<li>Make it quick</li>
	<li>Make it interactive</li>
	<li>Make it open</li>
	<li>Make it benefit oriented</li>
</ul>
<p>We found that the simple list preformed better as it reduced drop-off. Some user tests were run and after going through the list onboarding users seemed to understand the value of inkling where the other tests did not.</p>

<p>This simple three item list eventually made it into our authoring product with I designed and Ed Lea animated.</p>

<p>[IMAGE habitat onboarding]</p>


<h2>Nope</h2>
<p>We did not get the opportunity to go forth with the on boarding flow I had created due to timing and resources. We decided to go with a quicker flow, having users choose categories, preloading they library with relevant content, and getting them into the app quicker.</p>

<h2>Things I would have done differently</h2>
<p>While the interactive cards were exciting and intriguing, they prolong the process of someone quickly getting into the product. This made it harder for someone to immediately see the value of Inkling thus going against the premise of the onboarding.</p>

<p>I should have connected with engineering sooner and often as I was developing this to help work out this vision that I had. To pull out these various interactives and pair them with specific books was a huge feat and we did not have the development resources allocated for this project.</p>
