While writing this article I learned that I want my site to have a few things:

1. I love, love, love **large typography**. I think when done right it guides the viewer's eyes while helping them come to a nice pause as they read through a piece of text.
2. **Case studies** that pull back the curtains to reveal the heart of the designer and her decisions are really inspiring to me.
3. I am really drawn to **grids** that are rigid in structure but flexible to adapt to the needs of the content.
4. Having **personality** is simple in theory but difficult to implement as it is embedded in every aspect of your site and your work.

I'm feeling super inspired after looking at all these examples and next is to get sketchy with some wireframes and start thinking about the content for my case studies!
