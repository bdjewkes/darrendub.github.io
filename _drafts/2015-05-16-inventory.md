It was late February of 2012, I walked into the Design Lab at the University of San Francisco, sat down in a gray office chair, took a deep sigh and opened Adobe Dreamweaver. 

The events that followed are very cloudy but I emerged from my stupor with a place on the web to talk about my projects that I have done.

### Tools I used

- FTP: Fetch
- Text Editor: Textwrangler / Dreamweaver
- Domain: Godaddy
- Hosting: HostMonster
- Languages: HTML, Vanilla CSS

These tools are not inherently bad, the way I strung them all together is at fault. I would begin writing code in Textwrangler, transfer to Dreamweaver (I have no idea why), use Dreamweaver to make black magic, then drag that into Fetch, voil√° a website. I had no real version control, no testing, looking back on it now it felt like I just threw it up and hoped that nothing was broken.

That was the old me, this is the new me.
