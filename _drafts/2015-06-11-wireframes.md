I find that building out a few wireframes help visualize the various buckets for the content. I start to ask myself new questions; where will the visitor go from here? How might the grid handle 3 images? 4? Using wireframes as broad strokes help answer these questions and prepare you for the design phase.

###Site Architecture 

<ul>
	<li><b>Home</b></li>
	<li><b>Work</b></li>
	<li><b>Words</b></li>
	<li><b>About</b></li>
</ul>

I will have four major pages **work** will feature links to case studies and passion projects. **Words** will be my blog and **about** is about me.

###Super Digital

I will admit this process took me a bit longer as other projects needed my attention. I hope to focus on this redesign as I'm about to begin the fun designz & codez phase.
