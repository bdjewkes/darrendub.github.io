I built the first version of my current site in the spring of 2012. Back when I thought Dreamweaver was the only way to make things on the web. 
Here is a look at the applications and tools I use for my current site [darrendavenwong.com](http://darrendavenwong.com):

- FTP: Fetch
- Text Editor: Sublime Text 2
- Domain: Godaddy
- Hosting: HostMonster
