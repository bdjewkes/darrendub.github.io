		  <h4>Summary</h4>

		  <p>Paradise Soccer Club connects the beautiful game of soccer with the lifestyle of Hawaiâ€™i. I worked with PSC to build a website and e-commerce store to connect their brand to their fans across the world. </p>

		<h2 class="large-type text-center">Kick-off</h2>

		<p>Max and I grew up in the same town in Hawaii but I didnâ€™t get to know him until I moved away to San Francisco (funny how that happens). He played soccer with my best friend and thatâ€™s how we met. Hawaii does not have any professional sports teams, so many of its youth turn to the beautiful game as their favorite pastime. Max saw an opportunity to blend the culture of Hawaii with the sport of futbol and Paradise Soccer Club was born.</p>

		<p>It all started with his hugely popular Instagram account, but Max had bigger dreams. He opened his storefront in Kailua, Oahu on June 21, 2013 to open arms from the community. The locals' support coupled with his already successful social media presence and collaborations with Hawai'i's premier lifestyle brands acted as the catalyst for PSC to explode on to the scene.</p>

		<p>More importantly PSC isnâ€™t just about selling products, itâ€™s about giving back to the community. They host soccer tournaments, FIFA tournaments, and gives away merchandise to its winners. PSC has been and will always be an ohana for those who love the beautiful game.</p>

		<h2 class="large-type text-center">Passing the ball</h2>

		<p>I started talking with Max in June 2013, we kicked a few emails back and forth and identified a lot of areas where I could help. He wanted to provide his Instagram followers with more information about his shop. He was also in talks to begin producing his own merchandise. He needed a website to help facilitate these two goals.</p>
		<img class="width-75 center" alt="Email Correspondence" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/img/paradise-soccer-club/email-correspondence.png">

		<p>Itâ€™s important to note that PSC is run and operated by Max alone. He doesnâ€™t have content generators, inventory managers, marketing analysts, he didnâ€™t even have a website. I was happy to help out a friend and excited to help push this brand forward. </p>

		<p>I started by asking a few questions:</p>

		<h4>What do you want the site to achieve?</h4>

		<p>He wanted to communicate his brand and his product offerings to his
		fans. He also wanted a place to sell his products.</p>

		<h4>Who is your target audience?</h4>

		<p>He identified that his core audience would be teens to twenty-somethings
		passionate about soccer. He also identified families as children getting
		interested in soccer could grow into customers.</p>

		<h4>Will you need to update it?</h4>

		<p>He didn't have a need to update the sites code but wanted to actively
		post a blog portion about sales and events.</p>

		<h4>What is the current site setup?</h4>

		<p>At this point, PSC's only digital presence was their Instagram account, which was very popular (8,000+ followers). A lot of traffic would be driven from his social media so it was important to really nail the mobile experience. He was using Godaddy to park his domain with no hosting. Here is the initial
		sitemap:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Homepage</li>

		<li>About Us</li>

		<li>Contact Us</li>

		<li>Events</li>

		<li>Blog</li>

		<li>Shop</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This was definitely enough to get started.</p>

	<h2 class="large-type text-center">Phases</h2>

	<p>We started talking a couple days before the opening of his physical storefront and while I would have loved to release a fully functioning site by then, it wasn't going to happen. There was still a lot to talk about and a lot of direction to be hashed out. We decided to roll the site out in phases. </p>

	<h4>Phase One: The Great Image</h4>

	<p>The first phase was to announce the grand opening of the store front. Max
	wanted something: "Simple, clean, with logo front and center or a pic." We
	had a tight turn around so I turned to Tumblr to quickly execute against the
	first phase.</p>

	<h4>Phase Two: Fake it 'til you make it</h4>

	<p>Phase two was the first attempt to fulfill his need to update the blog,
	but not the rest of the site. He was very active on Instagram and an integration with the app would be the least amount of friction for Max. I linked his account to tumblr so that every time he posted to Instagram he had the option to post to his blog.
	This worked out pretty well and is still how the blog portion operates today.
	This second phase was also where I laid the ground work of the sites
	architecture. We were still using Tumblr for hosting and since we were not
	building a full fledged theme we were limited to its basic html/css
	capabilities... even external css was a struggle ðŸ˜” (more on that later). But
	it was enough to rough out some early ideas of the site.</p>

		  <small>Phase Two</small>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h4>Phase Three: Goooool</h4>

	<p>The last and final phase was a full site with a complete e-commerce
	store.</p>

	<p>We started by narrowing down the site map:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Home</li>

	<li>About</li>

	<li>Shop</li>

	<li>Contact</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It was time to graduate the site, taking it off tumblr and on to its own hosting, using SASS to build repeatable patterns, developing the story, and most importantly creating an e-commerce store.</p>

	<h5>Square Corners The Market</h5>

	<p>When building the store I was looking into various options: Stripe, Shopify, and Snipcart. And while each had their merits, I discovered that he was already using Square in his physical store to sell his products and manage inventory. It made a lot of sense to tie into this system to keep everything in one place. Square makes it super easy to spin up an online store. One key feature is the ability generate product embed codes that can be placed anywhere on the internet.  </p>

	<h5>Patterns</h5>

	<p>I went back to the wireframe stage and started to block out patterns I would be using.</p>

	<img class="" alt="Phase 03 Patterns" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/img/paradise-soccer-club/phase-3.png">

	<p>For the About Us page, we wanted to include a section about the events PSC hosted. He had a lot of great video content from these events and we wanted to incorporate that somehow. We landed on an
	auto-looping video shot by <a class="link-text" href="https://vimeo.com/botoboyfilms">Orrin Nakanelua</a>.</p>

	<h4>Finger Tips</h4>

	<p>We identified his core audience as twenty-somethings using all the social medias. It was important that the site be optimized for mobile finger tips. I began building the patterns with mobile in mind and had a lot of fun exploring the navigation. We made a conscious decision to only link to SHOP at smaller screen sizes to encourage more mobile transations.</p>

	</div>

	<h4>News Letters</h4>

	<p>Instagram was PSC's main marketing channel. I wanted to introduce a secondary channel that would build a list of new customers, cultivate relationships with existing customers, and reach them on all their mobile devices. I'm talking about electronic mail. With the help of Mailchimp we set up a simple input to capture email addresses with the hopes of running full campaigns through email.</p>

	</div>

	<h4>Launch</h4>

	<p>We launched the site in accordance with the first anniversary of the storefront opening. This was also during the 2014 Men's World Cup. Max expertly timed a product release to coincide with the new site and the world cup. His <a class="link-text" href="">Merica Jersey</a> was very well received, it helped catapult the site and his brand during the launch and is still the top selling item in his outline store.</p>

<h2 class="large-type text-center">Offsides</h2>

<p class="text-center mt-1">Or things I learned along the way</p>

<h4>Not all that squares, is gold</h4>

<p>Using Square came with a few drawbacks. One of them being that the actual payment does not actually happen on the paradisesoccerclub.com site. When a user clicks a product they <em>subtly</em> get redirected to the PSC Online shop on Square Market. While this is not terrible, it does introduce another step in the buying process and my focus was to minimize the experience of that step. Another issue arose with the the embedding of products on the store. The embded code used a bit of Javascript which took some time to call the products from Square and in most cases there could be a noticable lag of the items being generated on our site. I am looking into hosting the items on our end for a snappier web experience. </p>

<p>All in all our decision to leverage square for the online store has been a good one. We're using an existing platform that he is using in the physical store and we can depend on the security of a well-known payments company to handle the online and in-store purchases. Another huge reason for using Square is that it managed product fulfillment all in the same web app. Which is great because Max only needs to go to one place to get information about sales, inventory, and orders. Easy peasy. </p>

<h4>Stop trying to make newsletter happen</h4>

<p>While building the site I thought it would be great to begin capturing email addresses in hopes of building an active cycle to market existing customers and new customers. Mailchimp was extremely easy to use and integrate and we started collect some email addresses.</p>

<p><b>Where we went wrong.</b> We did not accurately scope the time and effort to create, deliver, and nurture amazing campaigns. We sent two emails total which were well received but our list is still too small to make an impact. In the future I'd like to help him streamline this process, possibly generating emails from his Instagram account. </p>

<h4>Phases, or nah</h4>

<p>I think rolling the site out in phases was a great idea. It helped Max get his feet wet into his brand new website. However it took a while to reach the final site because it introduced some technical debt early on. I needed to get the site out fast so using tumblr was a no-brainer. However, when it was time to build the actual site I was not able to leverage most of the code base (a lot of interal css styles and strange markup). I think if I had asked more pointed questions up front I could have identified his needs quickly and we would have arrived at the brand new site sooner.</p>

<h4>Recap</h4>

<p>There were a lot of learnings and a lot of fun explorations. Overall it was a great project to work on. We made improvements that significantly impacted his business and pushed a great brand forward!</p>
