    <h4>Map</h4>
    <p>With this information about the two types of users I created a map to visualize their individual journeys.</p>
    <img src="/public/img/open-garage/sketch-map.jpg">
    <p><img class="icon-inline" src="/public/img/open-garage/avatar-seller-dark.svg"> <b>Seller</b> &#8594; Has something to sell &#8594; Hosts a garage sale &#8594; Makes all the money!</p>
    <p><img class="icon-inline" src="/public/img/open-garage/avatar-buyer-dark.svg"> <b>Buyer</b> &#8594; Actively or passively looking &#8594; Sees a thing they want &#8594; Buys thing!</p>
    <p>I decided to focus on the <b>seller</b> journey specifically around <b>hosting a garage sale</b>. Given more time to dive in, I would of looked into how this related to the buyer journey seeing where there were similarities and making that hand-off as seamless as possible.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center mt1">The Process</h1>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>I looked at examples of similar platforms for buyers and sellers, analyzing patterns and systems that I thought were effective. I liked the big images of <a class="link-text" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snkrs/id911130812?mt=8">Snkrs</a> and <a class="link-text" href="https://canopy.co/">Canopy</a>. Yelp's nearby filter. Etsy's collection and search filters. I had a clear focus on the seller journey which helped narrow the feature set relevant to sellers.</p>
    <img src="/public/img/open-garage/research.jpg">
    <p>Then I started to sketch/list out all the things that would make a seller successful in hosting an event:</p>
    <img src="/public/img/open-garage/sketch-research.jpg">
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to upload photos</li>
      <li>Easy to show location of garage sale</li>
      <li>Times and dates of garage sale</li>
      <li>Pricing of items</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<section class="bg-light-gray">
  <div class="container">
        <h4>Storyboard</h4>
    <p>From there I began to storyboard out how a seller might discover, download, create a garage sale using OpenGarage.</p>
    <img src="/public/img/open-garage/sketch-storyboard.jpg">
    <ol>
      <li>Perhaps they see an ad on social media for a garage sale app (or are looking for it in the app store)</li>
      <li>Download app from app store</li>
      <li>On launch, OpenGarage asks if it can use location to show you nearby garage (this will help give the seller an idea about how they want to set up their garage sale, this also reduces the barrier to entry, once they see the value they are more likely to sign up)</li>
      <li>Seller is prompted or sees the CTA to "host a garage sale"</li>
      <li>OpenGarage asks for name, email, location, date of event (will use this information to populate event)</li>
      <li>Asks for name of event, other information (name, email, etc.) has already been provided by previous screens and prompts user to add photos</li>
      <li>Asks if OpenGarage can access photos, user can take photo or choose from library</li>
      <li>User selects photos</li>
      <li>Cards will build in prompting the user to name item, identify price, and comment on condition.</li>
      <li>Once the photos have been added, users can publish their garage sale</li>
      <li>There will be a prompt with a link to share on social media and sms</li>
      <li>After their event has been uploaded they are taken back to the initial screen with a list of nearby garage sales</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prototype</h4>
    <p>After putting together the storyboard I needed to validate the solutions I believed the app was accomplishing. However, I had a very limited time to run tests, I was able to have one tester run through the prototype which is not nearly as many data points as I would like but it did reveal some findings. I gave the tester a prompt of downloading an app that would help them create a garage sale. I then asked them to create a garage sale once they dowloaded the app.</p>

    <h4>High Fidelity Mock</h4>
    <p>I chose to focus on the add item feature, specifically the adding information and saving actions. As a user selects images to add to their OpenGarage event they are prompted to add additional information about each item. If multiple images are selected cards build up and stack behind the first image. There are three actions, saving, deleting, and skipping. When a item is saved, a blue border appears around the card and the entire card is whisked away to the right of the screen. If the item is deleted is moves to the left of the screen. When all cards have been saved, deleted, or skipped, a final card appears denoting that the user is finished with this task and prompts the user to view and publish their event.</p>

		<h4 class="text-white">Learnings</h4>
    <p class="text-white"><b>Onboarding</b><br>While conducting the test, it became clear that launching the tester into a "facebook-type" screen was confusing. I think clearer instructions would have helped here. I also think an initial onboarding screen introducing the app and guiding sellers </p>
    
    <p class="text-white"><b>Call to action</b><br>The goal of this experience was to enable a seller to easily host a garage sale. There are two ways to achieve this goal: a "Host your own garage sale" CTA near the top of the screen and an "Add event" icon in the nav bar below. The CTA was visually smaller than most of the elements on the page and did not command the correct hierarchy of an action</p>
    <p class="text-white"><b>Updates</b><br>
     The rest of the flow went as expected, the tester was able to add photos and begin a garage sale. Some clear next steps are to add a simple onboarding screen to help orient a new user. Ensure the host event CTA has more prominent and include the created garage sale on the final screen.</p>
    <h4 class="text-white">Final Thoughts</h4>
    <p class="text-white">This solves a few of the problems experienced by sellers. If an app can allow easy uploading of photos and can create and event with a few taps the experience of hosting a garage sale will less daunting. This would also help with marketing as sellers can share their events on social media easily. Outside of an app, OpenGarage would send sellers a Host Kit which would include materials for signs, markets, flags, shirts, square reader, and other elements that would help with a seamless event experience.</p>
