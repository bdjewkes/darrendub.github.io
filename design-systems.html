        <h4 class="">Summary</h4>
      <p class="">There were several problems with our existing email system.One, it was not maintainable, which meant I had to hand code them each time, and two, it was out of date with our current branding. We knew that an email could be the first point of contact from Inkling, so we wanted to ensure the best brand experience from the very first interaction.</p>

      <div class="grid-cell">
        <h4 class="">Result</h4>
      <p class="">Soon after launching the new email system, we needed to email our database with a flood of information—webinar signups, newsletters, product updates, ebook announcements. While before this would have been slow and disjointed, the new system effectively managed the stress of all these integrated communications. These templates have given our marketing team the tools they need to succeed.

    <h1 class="text-center">The Process</h1>
    <p>I designed and spec’ed out each element for the developer to ensure that she had everything she needed to be successful. It was important that these emails be built out in modular patterns so that they could be rearranged when needed without affecting the overall layout. I then implemented the emails into our marketing programs, such as Marketo.</p>
