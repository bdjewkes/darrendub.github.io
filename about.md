Greetings, my name is Darren. I design and develop for screens and things. I currently work on [inkling.com](http://inkling.com) designing extensible patterns and code to engage our visitors. 

I was born and raised on the island of Oahu. I went to school at the University San Francisco and have been living and working in the city ever since.

I'm really into side projects. I think it's important to do something purely for passion and fun, it helps us get away from the things we have to do and replace them with the things we want to do. 

<p class="message"><b>Current Side Project: </b><a href="http://smokedmeatsaturdays.com">Smoked Meat Saturdays</a> where a buddy and I host small get togethers for friends; we eat, drink and be merry.</p> 

I listen to a lot of Drake, he's the song bird of our generation. I watch a lot of Wes Anderson movies, my favorite movie of his is Moonrise Kingdom.

Have any questions? tweet me [@darrendub](http://twitter.com/darrendub) or you can reach me by [electronic mail](mailto:hello@darrendavenwong.com). You can also find my pixels on [dribbble](http://dribbble.com/darrendub) and my code on [github](http://github.com/darrendub).
