		  <h4 class="text-white">Summary</h4>
		  <p class="text-white">At it's core, Inkling helps people create content and in turn, measure the success of that content. The goal of this project was to help inspire creators of content to expand and imagine the possibilities of what they could create using Inkling.</p>
		  <h4 class="text-white">Problem</h4>
		  <p class="text-white">Weâ€™ve found that once people see the Inkling product, click the interactives, scroll the page, they come to an "ah-ha" moment. Everything seems to click and they see how they could use Inkling to their benefit. Our challenge was to help bridge a visitor to this "ah-ha" moment sooner, so they could understand the value of Inkling faster, and be more informed once they were ready to speak with us.</p>

		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>This was a huge cross-functional team effort and the deliverable was a collection of various pieces working together as a whole. These various pieces would come together under a single site: <a class="link-text" href="https://www.inkling.com/inspiration/">inkling.com/inspiration</a>. We knew early on that we wanted to feature the actual product. One way we accomplished this was to embed the templates on the site for a visitor to scroll and peruse. The second way was to embed the interactives (slideshows, flip cards, etc.) from the product. Embedding the product on the homepage was a first for the company and proved to have a substantial impact on lead conversion rate.</p><br>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<ul class="list-checkmark">
			<li>Here is the live website: <a class="link-text" href="http://inkling.com/inspiration">inkling.com/inspiration</a></li>
			<li>4 embedded templates</li>
			<li>3 dedicated ad campaigns</li>
			<li>4 how-to videos</li>
			<li>Email campaign</li>
			<li>Templates overview page</li>
			<li>Updated resources page</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The final result was an engaging, interactive site that helped educate and inspire our customers. The messaging developed through this campaign continues to be our strongest company-wide. The site and it's deliverables continue to drive more qualified leads into our pipeline by helping the customer get to the "ah-ha" moment</p>
