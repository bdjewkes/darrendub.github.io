		<h1>Email System</h1>
		<h4 class="text-white">Summary</h4>
		  <p class="text-white">Email is a very important piece of the sales funnel - it generates leads and nurtures those who aren’t quite ready to speak to a sales rep. I designed and helped implement an email system to help the company continue to drive leads while maintaining our brand style.</p>
		  <h4 class="text-white">Problem</h4>
		  <p class="text-white">Our existing email system was not maintainable and I was having to code them by hand each time. The email system was also out of date with our current branding. An email could be the first point of contact from Inkling, so we wanted to ensure the best brand experience from the very first interaction.</p>

		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>I designed and spec’ed out each element for the developer to ensure that she had everything she needed to be successful. It was important that these emails be built out in modular patterns so they could be rearranged when needed without affecting the overall layout. I then implemented the emails into our marketing programs such as Marketo.</p><br>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>We scaled our communications quickly. In a matter of months we had a need for webinar signups, newsletters, product updates, ebook announcements, etc. We turned to this system to handle the stress of all these integrated communications and it performed marvelously. We’ve sent hundreds of campaigns since the templates have been built. These templates have given our marketing team the tools they need to succeed.</p>
